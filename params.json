{"name":"EDMdesigner-API","tagline":"Documentation of the EDMdesigner API for integration projects","body":"EDMdesigner-API\r\n===============\r\n\r\n[EDMdesigner](http://www.edmdesigner.com) is a drag and drop tool for creating responsive HTML e-mail templates very quickly and painlessly, radically increasing your click-through rate. This documentation is to give you a detailed description about the EDMdesigner-API with which you can integrate our editor into any web-based system (e.g. a CRM, CMS, WebShop or anything else you can imagine).\r\n\r\nTo start developing with our api, please request an API_KEY (and a corresponding magic word) at info@edmdesigner.com.\r\n\r\nBasically, the only thing you have to do is to implement one side of the handshaking on your server. When the handshaking is done, you can use the sent object, in which you can find the functions that are communicating with our server.\r\n\r\nThe handshaking is built into the initialization process, so if you implemented the handshaking on your side, everything will work automatically.\r\n\r\nWe provide example implementations that include the handshaking as well. You can find the continously broading list at the end of this page at the Example implementations section. \r\n\r\n##### Table of content\r\n\r\n1. __[Initializin](#initializing)__  \r\n2. __[Handshaking](#handshaking)__  \r\n3. __[Api functions](#api-functions)__  \r\n  1.

In the second line you can see a route parameter in the script's src. By that you can tell the script where to look for the handshaking implementation. For example, if you implemented it in your index.php, you have to replace ##handshaking_route## with index.php. The first parameter is a user id from your system. It can be any string. The last parameter is an error callback which will be called in every request if the request fails. This is not required thus you can set an error callback in one of your function calls (see later) and in that case it will be called instead of this one.\r\n\r\nIn the resulting object (edmDesignerApi) you will find some functions through which you can interact with our system.\r\n\r\n### Handshaking\r\nTo implement the handshaking on your server, you need an API_KEY, a magic word (wich is delivered with your API_KEY), your user's IPv4 address and a timestamp. The logic that handles handshaking has to receive the userId too, because it has to be sent to our server as well. Our API implementation automatically sends the userId in a POST HTTP request. You can set this user id by the first parameter of the initEDMdesignerPlugin.\r\n\r\nAfter concatenating the API_KEY, the IPv4 address of your user, the timestamp (as a string) and your magic word, you have to create an md5 hash of the resulting string.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\thash = md5(API_KEY + ipv4 + timestamp + magic)\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this, you have to send the API_KEY, the userId, the IPv4 address, the timestamp and the generated md5 hash to our server at api.edmdesigner.com/api/token through HTTP.\r\n\r\nIf everything goes well, you get back a token, with which your user can be identified.\r\n\r\n# API functions\r\n## User functions\r\n### edmDesignerApi.listProjects([query], callback, onErrorCB)\r\nLists the projects of the actual user.\r\n#### Parameters:\r\n  * query {Object} /OPTIONAL/ You can set the parameters of the db search (you have to use the moongose.js query syntax, please check their [documentation](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html) for more information)\r\n    - find {Object} You can set the search terms. (For example: you can list only those projects which title starts with \"foo\": var query = {find: {title: {$regex: \"foo.*\"}})\r\n    - skip {Number} The number of project the search will skip \r\n    - limit {Number} The number of projects you want to get back\r\n    - sort {Object} You can set the order how you want to get back the projects\r\n  * callback {Function} A function to be called if the request succeeds\r\n  * onErrorCB {Function} A function to be called if the request fails\r\n\r\nThe response is an array of projects.\r\n\r\n#### Example:\r\n\t\r\n\t<script>\r\n\t\tinitEDMdesignerPlugin(\"TestUser\", function(edmDesignerApi) {\r\n\t\t\tedmDesignerApi.listProjects(function(result) {\r\n\t\t\t\tconsole.log(result);\r\n\t\t\t});\r\n\t\t}, onErrorCB);\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tfunction onErrorCB(error) {\r\n\t\t\tconsole.log(error);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t</script>\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### edmDesignerApi.listAndCountProjects([query], callback, onErrorCB)\r\nLists the projects of the actual user.\r\n#### Parameters:\r\n  * query {Object} /OPTIONAL/ You can set the parameters of the db search (you have to use the moongose.js query syntax, please check their [documentation](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html) for more information)\r\n    - find {Object} You can set the search terms.

This requires you to implement an upload route on your server and [configure](#configure-api-servers-gallery) our server (you have to do the configuration only once). The user can delete the images as well, so there should be an delete route on your server (it should be in the [gallery configuration](#configure-api-servers-gallery)) .\r\n\r\nWe will create a md5 hash from a timestamp and your magic word (The right order of the string concatenation: timestam + magic word). This two (the hash and the timestamp) will be sent to you in each of our requests (in the query). You recreate the hash in your server side and compare the two hashes. With this method you can ensure that the request really came from us.\r\n\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Upload route\r\nYou should implement a route on your server which we can use for image upload.\r\n\r\nType: POST\r\n\r\nWe will upload the images as the following. There will be \"userId\", \"hash\" and \"time\" fields in the query of the request:\r\n  - The \"userId\" will contain the id of the user (who wants to upload the image).\r\n  - The \"hash\" will be a string we use for authenticate ourself. We concatenate timestamp with your magic word (the right order of the concatenation: timestam + magicword) and create an md5 hash from it. With this hash you can ensure that the request came from us. \r\n  - The \"time\" will be the timestamp we used for creating the hash \r\n\r\nThe image will be uplaoded as a file (the field name will be \"file\") and there will be another field \"userId\", it will contain the same data as the query field \"userId\". There is a third field, called \"originalFileName\" which contains the name of the original file before the user started to upload it.  \r\nPlease note that if you use php on your server side then checking the content-tpye of the uploaded image with the $_Files[\"file\"][\"type\"] is not possible (it will be Application/octet-stream) but if you use our hash to authenticate us, then you do not have to worry about the uploaded file. We will make sure that it will be what it has to be.\r\n\r\nIf you progress our request by php, reading our sent data may need a special way like the example below: \r\n\r\n\t$json = file_get_contents(\"php://input\");\r\n\t$values = json_decode($json, true);\r\n\r\n\t$someValue = $values[\"someValue\"];\r\n\r\nFurther info about this issue can be read in this article: \r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/11990767/post-empty-when-curling-json\r\n\r\n  \r\nThe response to our post request should be a json object. The object should have the following properties:\r\n  * url {String} /REQUIRED/ The url where the newly uploaded image can be found.\r\n  * secure_url {String} Http secure version og the image url\r\n  * thumb_url {String} An url where the thumbnail version of the image is available (Tha gallery can work a lot faster if you can provide a thumbnail)\r\n  * name {String} The name of the image. If it is not given then we will you the last segment of the url\r\n  * width {Number} The original width of the image (It can save a lot of process if you can provide this information)\r\n  * height {Number} The original height of the image (It can save a lot of process if you can provide this information)\r\n\r\nOr if you want to response with some kind of error (for example an error message), then you have to send an error object with the following property:\r\n  * err\r\n\r\nFor example:  \r\n\tvar error = {\r\n\t\terr: \"Not my user!\"\r\n\t};\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Delete route\r\nYou should implement a route on your server side which we can use for deleting images.\r\n\r\nType: POST\r\n\r\nThere will be \"hash\" and \"time\" fields in the query of the request:\r\n  - The \"hash\" will be a string we use for authenticate ourself. We concatenate timestamp with your magic word (the right order of the concatenation: timestam + magicword) and create an md5 hash from it. With this hash you can ensure that the request came from us.\r\n  - The \"time\" will be the timestamp we used for creating the hash \r\n\r\nWe will post an object with two parameters:\r\n  * url {String} The url of the deleted image\r\n  * userId {String} The id of the user who deleted the image.\r\n\r\nIf you progress our request by php, reading our sent data may need a special way like the example below: \r\n\r\n\t$json = file_get_contents(\"php://input\");\r\n\t$values = json_decode($json, true);\r\n\r\n\t$someValue = $values[\"someValue\"];\r\n\r\nFurther info about this issue can be read in this article: \r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/11990767/post-empty-when-curling-json\r\n\r\n  \r\nYour response to our post request should be 200. (HTTP status code)  \r\nOr if you want to response with some kind of error (for example an error message), then you have to send an error object with the following property:\r\n  * err\r\n\r\nFor example:  \r\n\tvar error = {\r\n\t\terr: \"Not my user!\"\r\n\t};\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Copy route\r\nIF you want to copy a project from a user to an other and want to copy the images (which are used in the project) too, you need to use the [create from to with images route](#creat-from-to-with-images). This route will collect the urls of the images (which you host) of the project and send it to you. After that you should make a copy of this images to the target user and sent us back the parameters of this new images.\r\n\r\nType: POST  \r\n\r\nThere will be \"hash\" and \"time\" fields in the query of the request:\r\n  - The \"hash\" will be a string we use for authenticate ourself. We concatenate timestamp with your magic word (he right order of the concatenation: timestam + magicword) and create an md5 hash from it. With this hash you can ensure that the request came from us. \r\n  - The \"time\" will be the timestamp we used for creating the hash \r\n\r\n\r\nWe will post an object whit the following parameters:\r\n  * urls {Array} It contains the urls of the images which are used in the template\r\n  * from_userId {String} The id of the users from who we want to copy the template to the target user\r\n  * target_userId {String} The id of the user who will get the new template. (This user needs the new urls)\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you progress our request by php, reading our sent data may need a special way like the example below: \r\n\r\n\t$json = file_get_contents(\"php://input\");\r\n\t$values = json_decode($json, true);\r\n\r\n\t$someValue = $values[\"someValue\"];\r\n\r\nFurther info about this issue can be read in this article: \r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/11990767/post-empty-when-curling-json\r\n\r\n  \r\nYour response to our post request should be an object. The object should have an \"urls\" property which should be another object. This object should have the following \"key - value\" pairs: the old url (which you get from the urls array we sent with the post request) should be the key and the value should be the parameters of the new image (like the one you need to send beack in the [upload route](#upload-route):\r\n  * url {String} /REQUIRED/ The url where the newly uploaded image can be found.\r\n  * secure_url {String} Http secure version og the image url\r\n  * thumb_url {String} An url where the thumbnail version of the image is available (Tha gallery can work a lot faster if you can provide a thumbnail)\r\n  * name {String} The name of the image. If it is not given then we will you the last segment of the url\r\n  * width {Number} The original width of the image (It can save a lot of process if you can provide this information)\r\n  * height {Number} The original height of the image (It can save a lot of process if you can provide this information)\r\n\r\nFor example: \r\nIf we uploaded the following array: [\"www.foo.bar\", \"http://test.com/image.jpg\"] then your asnwer should be something like this object:\r\n\t\r\n\tvar answer = { \r\n\t\turls: {\r\n\t\t\t\"www.foo.bar\": {\r\n\t\t\t\turl: \"www.copy.of.foo.bar\"\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\t\"http://test.com/image.jpg\": {\r\n\t\t\t\turl: \"http://test.com/copyimage.jpg\",\r\n\t\t\t\tsecure_url: \"https://test.com/copyimage.jpg\",\r\n\t\t\t\tthumb_url: \"http://test.com/thumb/copyimage.jpg\",\r\n\t\t\t\tname: \"copyimage.jpg\",\r\n\t\t\t\twidth: 600,\r\n\t\t\t\theight: 200\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t};\r\n\r\nOr if you want to response with some kind of error (for example an error message), then you have to send an error object with the following property:\r\n  * err\r\n\r\nFor example:  \r\n\tvar error = {\r\n\t\terr: \"Not my user!\"\r\n\t};\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n###Configure api server's gallery\r\nConfigure the api's gallery.\r\n\r\n#####Type\r\n  + POST\r\n\r\n#####Route\r\n  + //api.edmdesigner.com/json/gallery/config\r\n  \r\n#### Parameters (you should post):\r\n  * uploadRoute {String} /REQUIRED/ The [route](#upload-route) which we can use for uploading the images.

A header will appear on the top of their templates and the footer will appear on the bottom.\r\nThe users won’t be able to edit these two elements or remove them.  \r\nIf you upload any header and/or footer, then the affected users have to use one. If you want to have a group of users who don’t have to use any kind of header and/or footer, then do not upload header and/or footer to all of your users ([general upload](#upload-header-2)) or upload the group an empty header and/or footer. This way they can choose the empty one and then there will be no header and/or footer on their templates.  \r\nYou can upload different kind of headers and/or footers. If you do so, then the affected users will be able to choose which header they want to use, but they still have to use one of them.   \r\nThe newly created document will get a header and/or footer if the user (who created the project) has any header and/or footer. A user can have header and/or footer if it was uploaded directly to him or to his group or if there are headers and/or footers which were uploaded to every users. (The header and/or footer priority is the following: user’s personal headers and/or footers <  user’s group’s headers and/or footers < general headers and/or footers)\r\n\r\nThere is three different ways to upload headers. You can upload it:\r\n  - to all your user ([general header upload](#upload-headers-2)) \r\n  - to a specified group ([upload headers to group](#upload-headers)) \r\n  - to specified user or users ([upload headers to user](#upload-headers-1))\r\n\r\nFooters can be uploaded in the same ways:\r\n  - to everyone ([general footer upload](#upload-footers-2))\r\n  - to a specified group ([upload footers to a group](#upload-footers))\r\n  - to specified user or users ([upload footers to users](#upload-footers-1))\r\n\r\n\r\n### Structure\r\nThe representing object fore header or footer should have the following properties:\r\n  - document {Object} /REQUIRED/ it should be a json object ([which represent our templates](#json-document-descriptors))\r\n    - root /REQUIRED/ There should be the structure of the header or footer. __It must be a [\"FULLWIDTH_CONTAINER\"](#full-width-container) type!__\r\n    - generalSettings\r\n  - id {String} /REQUIRED/ this id is what we use for distinguish the headers from each other so __it should be unique!__ Please note that the id you want to use for the users headers should be different from the ids of the general headers or the ids of the user's group's headers. The same is true for the footers.\r\n  - title {Object} it should contains language code - title string pairs. For example: 'en': 'Green-white header'. The title will appear on the dropdown list. If you don't want to use any other localization then please use the 'en' language code, the default will always be the 'en' regardless of the actual language!  \r\n  - placeholders {Object} it is needed when you want to have more than one supported language on your headers or footers. If you want to know how do the placeholders work please read the [localization](#localization) part of the [headers & footers](#headers--footers) chapter.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\t\r\n\tvar headerOrFooter = {\r\n\t\t\"document\":  {\r\n\t\t\t\"root\": {\r\n\t\t\t\t\"leftChildren\" : [\r\n\t\t\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"text\" : \"<h1 style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\">##title##</h1>\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"type\" : \"TITLE\"\r\n\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"text\" : \"<p style=\\\"text-align: right;\\\">##example-palceholder##</p>\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"defaultText\" : \"Double click to edit\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"type\" : \"TEXT\"\r\n\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\t],\r\n\t\t\t\t\"rightChildren\": [],\r\n\t\t\t\t\"rightBackgroundColor\" : \"\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\"leftBackgroundColor\" : \"\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\"twoCell\" : \"false\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\"order\" : \"LTR\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\"type\" : \"FULLWIDTH_CONTAINER\"\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\t\"id\": \"My-example-header-or-footer-unique-id\",\r\n\t\t\"title\": {\r\n\t\t\t\"en\": \"example title\",\r\n\t\t \t\"hu\": \"példa cím\"\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\t\"placeholders\": { \r\n\t\t\t\t'##title##': {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t'en': 'The header is a good thing',\r\n\t\t\t\t\t'hu': 'A fejléc egy jó dolog',\r\n\t\t\t\t},\r\n\t \t\t\t'##example-palceholder##: {\r\n\t \t\t\t\t'en': 'It is an example',\r\n\t \t\t\t\t'hu': 'Ez egy példa',\r\n\t \t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t};\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Localization\r\nIt is possible to use different localization with the same headers and/or footers but __not required__.  \r\nIf you want to support only one language then you should \"hardcode\" the content of the header or footer to the representing json and it should work perfectly. In that case you do not have to use the placeholders object (see [stucture](#structure)).  \r\nIf you want to support more than one language, then you have to use the placeholders object. You should not write the actual content to the json instead you should use a placeholder (for example if you have a title element in your header or footer, then the text of the title should be the placeholder instead of the actual content. We will replace the placeholders in our application). You can give any kind of name to this placeholder, but it should begin and end with two '#' character (for example: ##title##.). After that you have to insert the placeholder to the placeholders object as follows: the key should be the name of the placeholder, and the value should be an object conatining the language code - value pairs of the actual content.  \r\nExample placeholders object: \r\n\r\n\tplaceholders: { '##title##': {\r\n\t\t\t\t'en': 'The header is a good thing',\r\n\t\t\t\t'hu': 'A fejléc egy jó dolog',\r\n\t\t\t\t//...\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t \t\t'##example-palceholder##: {\r\n\t \t\t\t'en': 'It is an example',\r\n\t \t\t\t'hu': 'Ez egy példa',\r\n\t \t\t\t//...\r\n\t \t\t\t}\r\n\t }\r\n\t \r\nYou can localize the name (title) of the headers and/or footers too. The title of a header or footer is the text which will appear on the dropdown list, where the user will be able to choose from them.  \r\nIf you want to support more than one language you just have to put the language code - text pair to the title object (see [structure](#structure)).\r\nAn example title object: \r\n\r\n\ttitle: { 'en': 'example title',\r\n\t\t 'hu': 'példa cím'\r\n\t\t /...\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\t\r\nIf you support a language but you do not want to give the header or footer a different title in the other language, you do not have to, but please note that this way the default title will be used on the dropdown list for this header, and the default is always the 'en' (english) version of the title.  \r\n\r\nExample:  \r\n_We support the english and the hungarian languages. We upload two headers with the following two title objects: title: {'en': 'first \theader'} and title: {'en': 'second header', 'hu': 'Második fejléc'}. If someone select the hungarian language, then in his dropdown \t\tlist there will be two selectable header: 'first header' and 'Második fejléc', but if someone choose the english version, then \t\tthe dropdown list will look like the following: 'first header' and 'second header'._  \r\n\r\nIf you do not give an 'en' (english) title to a header, then it will be generated automatically in our application, so it is suggested to always upload an 'en' version of the title too.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Upload Headers \r\nUpload a list of headers which __all of your users__ will be able to use.

This feature is created for make the template editing more fast so more effective.\r\nA complex elem can binded to a user, to a group of users or to all of the users.\r\nWhen a user uses the editor these binding displays all together and can be used all of them.\r\n\r\nThe administrator of the application can upload complex elems to all of the above possibilities.\r\nThe user of the editor can save complex elems only for him/herself, those will be added to the admin defined items.\r\nThe editor users can also delete those complex elems what are binded to him/herself as a user.\r\n\r\nThese are the 3 ways to upload complex elems as an admin:\r\n  - to all your user ([general complexElems upload](#upload-complex-elems-to-all-users)) \r\n  - to a specified group ([upload complexElems to group](#upload-complex-elems)) \r\n  - to specified user or users ([upload complexElems to user](#upload-complex-elems-to-specified-users))\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Structure\r\nThe representing object for a Complex elem should have the following properties:  \r\n  - doc {Object} /REQUIRED/ it should be a json object (which represent our templates)\r\n    - type /REQUIRED/ It must be [\"BOX\"](#box), [\"MULTICOLUMN\"](#multicolumn) or [\"FULLWIDTH_CONTAINER\"](#full-width-container)\r\n    - generalSettings\r\n  - id {String} /optional/ this id is what will identify the item for you if you would like to manage it via admin\r\n  - title {Object} /optional/ it should contains language code - title string pairs. For example: 'en': 'Green-white complexElem'. If you miss to give it, we it will receive a default name. The title will appear on the list of the complex element. If you don't want to use any other localization then please use the 'en' language code, the default will always be the 'en' regardless of the actual language!  \r\n\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n\r\n### Localization\r\nIt is possible to use different localization with the same complex elem but __not required__.\r\nYou can localize the title of the complex elem. The title of a complex elem will appear on the list, where the user will be able to choose from.  \r\nIf you want to support more than one language you just have to put the language code - text pair to the title object (see [structure](#structure)).\r\nAn example title object: \r\n\r\n\ttitle: { 'en': 'example title',\r\n\t\t 'hu': 'példa cím'\r\n\t\t /...\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n\r\n## Dynamic Elements\r\nThis element is good for those who want their users to be able to change their emails/templates content easily. Users can add a dynamic element to their templates and choose which type of content will it display ([structure](#dynamic-element-structure), how will it look like ([template](#dynamic-element-template) and what the actual content will be ([data](#dynamic-element-data)).  \r\nYou can upload any number of different dynamic element type ([structure](#dynamic-element-structure), and create any number of different looks ([template](#dynamic-element-template) for your structures and assign any number of content ([data](#dynamic-element-data)) to those too.\r\nYou can even choose which type of dynamic elements can your user use, or users belonging to a specified group. You even can set which templates can someone use or not. There is even an option for making a dynamic element type/template to be available for all of your users.\r\nPlease note that the data can only be added to groups or specified users.\r\n\r\n### Dynamic element structure\r\nThe structure is the main part of the dynamic element. It specifies the type of the dynamic element. For example, it can be a \"Product\" (which means that the dynamic element will be able to display products), or a \"company\" or whatever you want. It is the connection between [data](#dynamic-element-data) and [templates](#dynamic-element-template). It describe how the data's structure should look like (which kind of placeholders should it use, etc) and which placeholders should a template contains. It also contains a default content for the dynamic elements. When a user choose a structure , then the default content will appear and the user can change it with selecting one of his data.  \r\nThe structure is very important , because every templates and data have to be assign to one of your structures!\r\n\r\nYou can assign structures to:  \r\n  - all of your users ([add to apiClientInstance](#add-structures-to-everyone))\r\n  - a specified group ([add to group](#add-structures-to-group))\r\n  - a specified user or users ([add to user](#add-structures-to-users))\r\n\r\nA structure object should have the following properties:\r\n  - id {String} This id is very __important__. You have to use it everywhere, so choose carefully! It should be unique!\r\n  - label {Object} It should contain \"language code - title\" pairs. It works like the headers and footers title property (you can read about it [here](#localization)). Please note that the 'en' language code will be the default label! If you do not give any 'en' version, then we will generate one.\r\n  - placeHolders {Object} It should contain \"placeholder - default value\" pairs. A placeholderder can be any kind of string with two '#' character at the beginning and the end of it. (example: \"##correctPlaceHolder##\"). It works almost similar like the headers and footers placeholders (expect , here you do not have to use localization). You can read more about the header and footer placeholders [here](#localization).\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\t\r\n\tvar structure = {\r\n\t\tid: \"my-structure-id\",\r\n\t\tlabel: {\r\n\t\t\t'en': 'Product',\r\n\t\t\t'hu': 'Termék'\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\tplaceHolders: {\r\n\t\t\t'##title##': 'default title',\r\n\t\t\t'##image-src##': 'http://default.image.src',\r\n\t\t\t'##description##': 'default foo bar description',\r\n\t\t\t'##price##': '0'\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t};\r\n\r\n\r\n### Dynamic element template\r\nThe template is responsible for the visual appearance of a dynamic element. A template always has to be assigned to a [structure](#dynamic-element-structure) and it has to contain the placeholders which the structure define. It is important because when the user choose a [data](#dynamic-element-data) for the dynamic element, then the placeholders will be replaced with actual content.\r\nYou can assign any number of templates to a structure.  \r\n\r\nYou can create templates to:\r\n  - all of your users ([add to apiClientInstance](#add-templates-to-everyone))\r\n  - a specified group ([add to group](#add-templates-to-group))\r\n  - a specified user or users ([add to user](#add-templates-to-users))\r\n\r\nA template object should have the following properties:\r\n  - id {String} If you do not give any id then we will generate one.\r\n  - label {Object} It should contain \"language code - title\" pairs. It works like the headers and footers title property (you can read about it [here](#localization)). Please note that the 'en' language code will be the default label! If you do not give any 'en' version, then we will generate one.\r\n  - doc {Object} Json document ([see more](#json-document-descriptors)). It must be [\"BOX\"](#box) or [\"MULTICOLUMN\"](#multicolumn)! (of course, it can have any number of children). Please note that it cannot contain any or be a [\"FULLWIDTH_CONTAINER\"](#full-width-container)!\r\n  - structureId {String} The id of the structure which the template belongs to.\r\n\r\nExample: \r\n\r\n\tvar template = {\r\n\t\tid: 'my-template-id',\r\n\t\tlabel: {\r\n\t\t\t'en': 'Simple Template',\r\n\t\t\t'hu': 'Sima Sablon'\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\tdoc: {\r\n\t            \"children\" : [ \r\n\t                {\r\n\t                    \"text\" : \"<h1 style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\">##title##</h1>\",\r\n\t                    \"type\" : \"TITLE\"\r\n\t                }, \r\n\t                {\r\n\t                    \"originalHeight\" : \"0\",\r\n\t                    \"originalWidth\" : \"0\",\r\n\t                    \"sizeType\" : \"FIXED\",\r\n\t                    \"link\" : \"\",\r\n\t                    \"altText\" : \"\",\r\n\t                    \"src\" : \"##image-src##\",\r\n\t                    \"id\" : \"\",\r\n\t                    \"align\" : \"center\",\r\n\t                    \"type\" : \"IMAGE\"\r\n\t                }, \r\n\t                {\r\n\t                    \"text\" : \"<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\">##description##</p>\",\r\n\t                    \"type\" : \"TEXT\"\r\n\t                }, \r\n\t                {\r\n\t                    \"text\" : \"<p style=\\\"text-align: right;\\\">price: ##price##</p>\",\r\n\t                    \"type\" : \"TEXT\"\r\n\t                }\r\n\t            ],\r\n\t            \"type\" : \"BOX\"\r\n    \t\t},\r\n    \t\tstructureId: \"my-structure-id\"\r\n\t};\r\n\r\n### Dynamic element data\r\nThe data contains the actual content of the dynamic element. A template always has to be assigned to a [structure](#dynamic-element-structure) and it has to contain \"placholder - value \" (example: \"##placeholder##\": \"value\") for every placeholders the structure contains.  \r\nYou can assign any number of data to a structure.  \r\n\r\nYou can add data to:\r\n  - a specified group ([add to group](#add-data-to-group))\r\n  - a specified user or users ([add to user](#add-data-to-users))\r\n\r\nA Data object should have the following properties: \r\n  - id {String} If you do not give any id then we will generate one.\r\n  - label {Object} /REQUIRED/ It should contain \"language code - title\" pairs. It works like the headers and footers title property (you can read about it [here](#localization)). Please note that the 'en' language code will be the default label! If you do not give any 'en' version then we will generate one.\r\n  - palceHolders {Object} /REQUIRED/ It should contain \"placeholder - default value\" pairs. A placeholderder can be any kind of string with two '#' character at the beginning and the end of it. (example: \"##correctPlaceHolder##\"). It works almost similar like the headers and footers placeholders (expect , here you do not have to use localization). You can read more about the header and footer placeholders [here](#localization).\r\n  - structureId {String} /REQUIRED/ The id of the structure which the data belongs to.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n\tvar data = {\r\n\t\tid: 'my-data-id',\r\n\t\tlabel: {\r\n\t\t\t'en': 'EDM beer'\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\tplaceHolders: {\r\n\t\t\t'##title##': 'EDM beer',\r\n\t\t\t'##image-src##': 'http://www.beer100.com/images/beermug.jpg',\r\n\t\t\t'##description##': 'Best beer ever! You should try it!',\r\n\t\t\t'##price##': '10$'\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\tstructureId: 'my-structure-id'\r\n\t};\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Create Structures\r\nYou can create one or more structure for your [dynamic elements](#dynamic-elements) with this route.

If you configured the gallery noUploadText (see [gallery config](#configure-api-servers-gallery)) text then it will appear on the upload tab, otherwise a default text will be used.\r\n    - noUrl {Bollean} If you set this parameter true, then the users of this group cannot use any image not hosted by you. The image from url tab of the gallery will disappear if the feature does not allowed.\r\n    - limit {Number} The number of images the user can upload. If you do not want to set any limit then leave this parameter undefined. If a user reach the limit, then he won't be able to upload any more image and if you configured the gallery limitReached (see [gallery config](#configure-api-servers-gallery)) text then it will be displayed otherwise a default text will be used.  Please note that the 0 limit and the noUpload are almost equivalent except a different message will appear on the upload tab if you use one or the other.\r\n\r\nThis list is constantly expanding with time!\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nFeature configuration\r\n---------------------\r\nThis is a new development which will be used everywhere from the next api version. Right now it is only used in a few features ([code elements](#code-elements), [texteditor buttons](#wysiwyg-texteditor-buttons), [header buttons](#header-button)).\r\nIt is quite similar to the [feater switch](#feature-switch), but it is a little bit \"smarter\". Here you can configure the features on four different level. Each level inherits the upper levels configuration but has greater priority.  Basicly the configurationions are merged into each other, but the lower levels always override the inherited configurations, if they have different configuration, but not everything, only the affected settings. The inheritance chain is the following:\r\n\r\napiClient -> apiClientInstance(apiKey) -> group -> user.\r\n\r\nFor example, we have a configuration named \"feature\" on apiClient level with value 5. We have to users with different groups, in one of this two groups we override this feature with value 8. So the user who belongs to this group will get a feature configuration with feature 8 (he inherited 5 from the apiClient, but his group overrided it to 8, so in the en he inherited feature 8) while the other user will get feature 5 (he inherited it from the apiClient's feature configuration).\r\n\r\nIf you want to disable a feature on one of this four levels, you have to give the feature a false value. (it is do not give any value to a feature then that feauter will be inherited from the upper levels, so it is important to give the feature a false value).\r\n\r\nFor example, we have a configuration named \"feature\" on apiClient level with value {\"number\": 5}. We have to users with different groups, in one of this two groups we override this feature with value false. So the user who belongs to this group won't get the feature configuration (he inherited {\"number\": 5} from the apiClient, but his group overrided it to false, so in the en he does not inherited this feature. this basicly means that this user cannot use the given feature) while the other user will get feature {\"number\": 5} (he inherited it from the apiClient's feature configuration, so he can use this feature).\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nJSON document descriptors\r\n-------------------------\r\nIn some cases you - as an integrator - migth want to use the raw document format instead of using the editor and fetch the document from the created project. Some example cases could be when you want to set custom headers and footers to some of your users or you want to create complex or dynamic element.\r\n\r\nWe can distiguish two main element descriptors, from which a whole document can be composed. These two main types are the containers and the leaf elements.\r\n\r\nEvery element has its type property. The possible values are the followings: \"BOX\", \"MULTICOLUMN\", \"ROOT\", \"TEXT\", \"TITLE\", \"IMAGE\", \"BUTTON and \"FULLWIDTH_CONTAINER\".\r\n\r\n##Containers\r\nContainers are used to group some elements and define the layout of the project. You can put any kind of elements into containers, so these elements can be other containers and leaf elements as well.\r\n###Box\r\nBoxes are great to hold other elements together, give them margins, paddings, borders and/or background.\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n\t{\r\n\t\ttype: \"BOX\",\r\n\t\tmargin: {\r\n\t\t\ttop: 0,\r\n\t\t\tright: 20,\r\n\t\t\tbottom: 0,\r\n\t\t\tleft: 20\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\tpadding: {\r\n\t\t\ttop: 10,\r\n\t\t\tright: 10,\r\n\t\t\tbottom: 10,\r\n\t\t\tleft: 10\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\tborder: {\r\n\t\t\ttop: {\r\n\t\t\t\tstyle: \"solid\",\r\n\t\t\t\twidth: 1,\r\n\t\t\t\tcolor: \"#aabbaa\"\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\tright: {\r\n\t\t\t\tstyle: \"dotted\",\r\n\t\t\t\twidth: 2,\r\n\t\t\t\tcolor: \"#aabbaa\"\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\tbottom: {\r\n\t\t\t\tstyle: \"dashed\",\r\n\t\t\t\twidth: 3,\r\n\t\t\t\tcolor: \"#aabbaa\"\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\tleft: {\r\n\t\t\t\tstyle: \"none\",\r\n\t\t\t\twidth: 0,\r\n\t\t\t\tcolor: \"#aabbaa\"\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\tbackground: {\r\n\t\t\tcolor: \"#00aaff\",\r\n\t\t\timage: {\r\n\t\t\t\tsrc: \"http://startups.hu/images/logos/edmdesigner.png\",\r\n\t\t\t\trepeat: \"no-repeat\",\r\n\t\t\t\tposition: \"top center\"\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\tchildren: [\r\n\t\t\t//puth the child elements here\r\n\t\t]\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\nThe properties what you can see in the example above, are optional.\r\n\r\n###Multicolumn\r\nMulticolumns are the main elements to create complex layouts. They can have multiple columns (we support max. 5 in our editor) and every columns can have children. Example:\r\n\r\n\t{\r\n\t\ttype: \"MULTICOLUMN\",\r\n\t\tcols: [\r\n\t\t\t[\r\n\t\t\t\t//children of the first column\r\n\t\t\t],\r\n\t\t\t[\r\n\t\t\t\t//children of the second column\r\n\t\t\t]\r\n\t\t]\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n###Root\r\nEvery document starts with this elem, as this is the top parent elem. It contains a full width container as a child what has a box inside as a child. It has no other property out of the children field. ({type: \"ROOT\", ... }) In the near future - when we will introduce the full width containers - it will change a little bit.  \r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n\t{\r\n\t\ttype: \"ROOT\",\r\n\t\tchildren: [\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\ttype: \"FULLWIDTH_CONTAINER,\r\n\t\t\t\tleftChildren: [\r\n\t\t\t\t\ttype: \"BOX\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t... any box properties ...\r\n\t\t\t\t],\r\n\t\t\t\torder: \"LTR\",\r\n\t\t\t\ttwoCell: false\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t]\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n###Full width container\r\nThe main feature of this element type will be that the background color can be full width, not only 600px as the root element.\r\nIt can only be a direct child of the root, so can be placed only in the highest level of the document structure. A fullwidth container can have 1 cell, or one left cell and one right cells divided from the middle. The cells can have their own background color. The elem can be set \"left to right\" or \"right to left\". In case of \"left to right\" setting the left cells will be ordered on the top if there is no enough room for both in the same line. In case of \"right to left\" the right cell will do so. If the element is set to be 1 celled, the order property determines that which cell is displayed. The content of the not visible cell always will be stored so will never be lost only not displayed.    \r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n\t{\r\n\t\ttype: \"FULLWIDTH_CONTAINER\",\r\n\t\torder: \"RTL\", (or \"LTR\")\r\n\t\ttwoCell: \"true\", (or \"false\")\r\n\t\tleftBackgroundColor: \"#aaaaaa\",\r\n\t\trightBackgroundColor: \"#FF0000\",\r\n\t\tleftChildren: [\r\n\t\t\t...any element except root and fullwidth container...\r\n\t\t],\r\n\t\trightChildren: [\r\n\t\t\t...any element except root and fullwidth container...\r\n\t\t]\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n##Leaf elements\r\nLeaf elements cannot have any child elements. These elements are typically the content elements.\r\n\r\n###Text\r\nThe text element must contain 2 fields: 'text' what can contain html code, but you should not put very complex things in i, and the 'type' with constant 'TEXT'. \r\nIn our editor we enable the simple text formatting options (bold, italic, underlined) and lists (ul, ol) and some other very simple things like h1, h2, h3.\r\nThe 'linkColor' and 'linkUnderLine' specifies the links styles for those <a> tags what has no inline style. The defaults values can be found in the example below. \r\nThe 'textStyles' specifies the style for those (non H1, H2, H3) text contents what have no inline specified style. The defaults values can be found in the example below. \r\nThe 'h1Styles', 'h2Styles' and 'h3Styles' specifies the style for those (H1, H2, H3) tags what have no inline specified style. The defaults values can be found in the example below. \r\nThe spacing specifies a padding values around the whole text div. The defaults values can be found in the example below. \r\n\r\n Example:\r\n\r\n\t{\r\n\t\ttext: \"yo <i>this</i> is Sparta\",\r\n\t\ttype: \"TEXT\",\r\n\t\tlinkColor: \"#5555ff\",\r\n\t        linkUnderLine: true,\r\n\t        textStyles: {\r\n\t            lineHeight: 14,\r\n\t            color\": \"#000000\",\r\n\t            size\": 14,\r\n\t            family\": \"arial\"\r\n\t        },\r\n\t         h3Styles: {\r\n\t            lineHeight: 32,\r\n\t            color\": \"#000000\",\r\n\t            size\": 32,\r\n\t            family\": \"arial\"\r\n\t        },\r\n\t         h2Styles: {\r\n\t            lineHeight: 26,\r\n\t            color\": \"#000000\",\r\n\t            size\": 26,\r\n\t            family\": \"arial\"\r\n\t        },\r\n\t         h1Styles: {\r\n\t            lineHeight: 20,\r\n\t            color\": \"#000000\",\r\n\t            size\": 20,\r\n\t            family\": \"arial\"\r\n\t        },\r\n\t\t\"spacing\": {\r\n                    \"left\": \"5\",\r\n                    \"bottom\": \"5\",\r\n                    \"right\": \"5\",\r\n                    \"top\": \"5\"\r\n                }\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n###Title\r\nTitle elements are just like texts, but we enable the users to set only h1, h2 and h3 as formatting.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n\t{\r\n\t\ttext: \"yo <i>this</i> is Sparta\",\r\n\t\ttype: \"TITLE\",\r\n\t\tlinkColor: \"#5555ff\",\r\n\t        linkUnderLine: true,\r\n\t         h3Styles: {\r\n\t            lineHeight: 32,\r\n\t            color\": \"#000000\",\r\n\t            size\": 32,\r\n\t            family\": \"arial\"\r\n\t        },\r\n\t         h2Styles: {\r\n\t            lineHeight: 26,\r\n\t            color\": \"#000000\",\r\n\t            size\": 26,\r\n\t            family\": \"arial\"\r\n\t        },\r\n\t         h1Styles: {\r\n\t            lineHeight: 20,\r\n\t            color\": \"#000000\",\r\n\t            size\": 20,\r\n\t            family\": \"arial\"\r\n\t        },\r\n\t\t\"spacing\": {\r\n                    \"left\": \"5\",\r\n                    \"bottom\": \"5\",\r\n                    \"right\": \"5\",\r\n                    \"top\": \"5\"\r\n                }\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n###Image\r\nImages are relatively complex elements. Just like boxes, they can have paddings, margins, borders, background color (no background image), but they can't have children. They have their own, special properties as well:\r\n  - src: the url of the image\r\n  - altText: the alt text\r\n  - link: you can wrapp in a link to your image with this propery\r\n  - originalWidth: the original width of the image\r\n  - originalHeight: the original height of the image\r\n  - width: the scaled width of the image (how width should it be in your newsletter)\r\n  - height: the scaled height of the image (how heigh should it be in your newsletter) - this is a must have property if you want your newsletters to render nice on outlooks\r\n\r\n###Button\r\nButton is relatively complex as well. It can have the following box properties: paddings, margins, borders, backgrouns (color and background image as well). In addition it can have radius. Baically button is a fancy link, so it has the following properties as well:\r\n  - text: the text what sould appear (it can be a simple html snippet as well)\r\n  - href: the link.\r\n  - sizeType: \"FIXED\" - exact amount of pixels, \"FIT_TO_TEXT\": the width will be based on the width of the text\r\n  - width: num of pixels if the sizeType is \"FIXED\"\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nIframe messaging\r\n-----------------------------\r\nThe [edmDesignerApi.openProject](#edmdesignerapiopenprojectprojectid-languagecode-settings-callback-onerrorcb) function will return an iframe. It is possible to communicate with this iframe with the [window.postMessage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.postMessage) native method.\r\n\r\n###Special elements and features\r\nThere are some speciel elements and functionalities what can be used with iframe messaging. You can configure most of this features in our [dashboard](dashboard.edmdesigner.com). The basic concept behind this feature is that this configurable elements and buttons will post a message (with [window.postMessage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.postMessage) native method which was mentioned above) to the parent window (it should be your site). You should handle the message on your side, it does not matter how, and send back the content with the corresponding action name ([see below](#possbile-messages-to-send)). For example: a popup window where the user can take some action, set what kind of content he wants to use, and you should send back this content wiht the right action name.\r\n\r\n###Code elements\r\nThis is a drag element in the editor which can be used to insert your own code snippet into the template (for example: a code in some kind of query language you will replace before sending out the email). You can have as many different kind of code elements as you want.  \r\nThe basic usecase of this element is the following: the user drop one code element into his template. He will see the placeholder (you configured for this code element type). With double click he can activate the element. It means that we will post you the [message](#code-element-message-format) you configured for this kind of code elements. There should be an interface in your site where the user can write/set the query string he wants to use in his template (this interface should pop up right after we posted the message). When he finished the string, it has to be posted back to us ([response format](#set-code-element-content)).\r\n__Please note that if you want the content to be unchanged/untouched in the generated html code then you should generate that code with the \"[generate without sanitizing](#generate-without-sanitizing)\" route (instead of the normal [generate](#generate) route. That way the generated code won't be safe enough, so after you replaced your query and/or placeholders YOU SHOULD SANITIZE the code (with [google caja](https://code.google.com/p/google-caja/wiki/JsHtmlSanitizer))__\r\n\r\n####Code element message format\r\nWhen a user use/activate a code element we post you (parent window) a message ([window.postMessage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.postMessage)). This message is a stringified javascript object what has two properties:\r\n  - action {String} The action name you configured for this type of code elements\r\n  - content {String} Previous content (if exists)\r\n\r\nexample: \"{\\\"action\\\": \\\"your action goes here\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"previous content or null\\\"}\"\r\n\r\n####Code element's structure\r\nA code element should have the following properties:\r\n  - id : The id/type of the code element. This is what distinguish one element from another.\r\n  - action : The message our iframe will send to you when a user activates a code element belonging to this configuration. (You can find how you have to respond to this message [here](#set-code-element-content)) \r\n  - toolbox title : The title of the toolbox the users will see when they select a code elements. It is localizable and works quite similar like the [header/footer localization](#localization).  Please note that the \"en\" value is the default value, so it should always be set.\r\n  - label : The name of the code elements. That will appear on the drag icon. It is localizable and works quite similar like the [header/footer localization](#localization). Please note that the \"en\" value is the default value, so it should always be set.\r\n  - placeholder : A correct document json ([see more](#json-document-descriptors)) what will appear in the editor as a placeholder for the code element. It must be [\"BOX\"](#box) or [\"MULTICOLUMN\"](#multicolumn)! (of course, it can have any number of children). Please note that it cannot contain any or be a [\"FULLWIDTH_CONTAINER\"](#full-width-container)!\r\n \r\nYou can configure your code elements for:\r\n  * [every instance](dashboard.edmdesigner.com/#codeElement/general)\r\n  * [every user belonging to one instance](dashboard.edmdesigner.com/#codeElement/instance)\r\n  * [a group of user](dashboard.edmdesigner.com/#codeElement/group)\r\n  * [some selected user](dashboard.edmdesigner.com/#codeElement/user)\r\n\r\nA user inherits a code element settings just like it is explained in the [feature configuration](#feature-configuration) part of the documentation\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n###Wysiwyg texteditor buttons\r\nYou can insert custom strings to the cursor position in the wysiwyg editor. With this feature you can configure texteditor buttons, which will appear in the wysiwyg editor's toolbar. There can be as many different texteditor buttons as you want. Each button can have its own label. If a user clicks one of this buttons, it posts a message to the parent window with [window.postMessage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.postMessage) native method. This messages can be configured too in our [dashboard](dashboard.edmdesigner.com).  \r\nThe basic usecase of a texteditor button: The user edits one of his text or title, and wants to insert some custom string so he clicks to one of the texteditor buttons. It posts the configured [message](#texteditor-button-message-format) to the parent window (which should be your site) where you should provide an interface where he can choose which custom string he wants to use. The selected string should be posted back with the right [action name](#insert-to-cursor-in-wysiwyg-editor) to our iframe.  \r\n__Please note that if you want the content to be unchanged/untouched in the generated html code then you should generate that code with the \"[generate without sanitizing](#generate-without-sanitizing)\" route (instead of the normal [generate](#generate) route. That way the generated code won't be safe enough, so after you replaced your placeholders YOU SHOULD SANITIZE the code (with [google caja](https://code.google.com/p/google-caja/wiki/JsHtmlSanitizer))__\r\n\r\n###Texteditor button message format\r\nWhen a user clicks a texteditor button, we post you (parent window) a message. This message is a stringified json with two parameters:\r\n  - action {String} The action name you configured for this type of code elements\r\n  - content {String} The selected text in the editor (if there is any. It will be null if there is no selected text). Plesae note that the selected text will always be overriden with the content you send in the [repsonse](#insert-to-cursor-in-wysiwyg-editor). If you want to keep the selected text then you should send it back in/with your content.\r\n\r\nexample: __\"{\\\"action\\\": \\\"the action you configured for this texteditor button\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"the selected text or null if there is no selected text\\\"}\"__\r\n\r\n###Texteditor button's structure\r\nA texteditor button configuration has the following parameters:\r\n  - id : The id/type of the texteditor button. This is what distinguish one button from another.\r\n  - action : The message our iframe will send to you when a user clicks the texteditor button belonging to this configuration. (You can find how you have to respond to this message [here](#insert-to-cursor-in-wysiwyg-editor)) \r\n  - label : The name of the button. This will appear as the label of the button. It is localizable and works quite similar like the [header/footer localization](#localization). Please note that the \"en\" value is the default value, so it should always be set.\r\n\r\nYou can configure your texteditor buttons for:\r\n  * [every instance](dashboard.edmdesigner.com/#textEditorButton/general)\r\n  * [every user belonging to one instance](dashboard.edmdesigner.com/#textEditorButton/instance)\r\n  * [a group of user](dashboard.edmdesigner.com/#textEditorButton/group)\r\n  * [some selected user](dashboard.edmdesigner.com/#textEditorButton/user)\r\n\r\nA user inherits a texteditor button settings just like it is explained in the [feature configuration](#feature-configuration) part of the documentation\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n###Header button\r\nWith this feature it is possible to insert your own code snippet into the head part of the email template. If you choose to use this feature then a button will appear in the DEFAULTS settings part in the editor. It is a fully customizable button, it's label, it's toolbox's title and the message type it sends when clicked, can be configured through our [dashboard](dashboard.edmdesigner.com).  \r\nThe basic usecase of a header button: The user wants to insert a query string to the head part of his template, so he clicks the header button. It posts the configured [message](#header-button-message-format) to the parent window (which should be your site) where you should provide an interface where he can create the query string he wants to use. The created string should be posted back with the right [action name](#insert-to-cursor-in-wysiwyg-editor) to our iframe.\r\n\r\n###Header button message format\r\nWhen a user clicks the header button, it posts you (parent window) a message. This message is a stringified json with two parameters:\r\n  - action {String} The action name you configured for this type of code elements\r\n  - content {String} Previous content (if exists)\r\n\r\nexample: __\"{\\\"action\\\": \\\"the action you configured for this heaer button\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"previous content or null\\\"}\"__\r\n\r\n###Header button's structure\r\nA haeder button configuration has the following parameters:\r\n  - action : The message our iframe will send to you when a user clicks the header button. (You can find how you have to respond to this message [here](#insert-to-cursor-in-wysiwyg-editor)) \r\n  - toolbox title : The title of the toolbox the users will see in the defaults settings. It is localizable and works quite similar like the [header/footer localization](#localization).  Please note that the \"en\" value is the default value, so it should always be set.\r\n  - button label : The name of the button. This will appear as the label of the button. It is localizable and works quite similar like the [header/footer localization](#localization). Please note that the \"en\" value is the default value, so it should always be set.\r\n\r\nYou can configure your header buttons for:\r\n  * [every instance](dashboard.edmdesigner.com/#headerButton/general)\r\n  * [every user belonging to one instance](dashboard.edmdesigner.com/#headerButton/instance)\r\n  * [a group of user](dashboard.edmdesigner.com/#headerButton/group)\r\n  * [some selected user](dashboard.edmdesigner.com/#headerButton/user)\r\n\r\nA user inherits a texteditor button settings just like it is explained in the [feature configuration](#feature-configuration) part of the documentation\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n###Possbile messages to send\r\nList of the events you can send to the iframe (as a message).  \r\n\r\n###Save Project\r\nIt is possible to manualy ask the iframe to save the actual (opened) project. As a response the iframe will post a [save result](#save-result) message.  \r\nThe message you need to send: __saveProject__\r\n\r\n###Force selected element to be deselected\r\nIt is possible to force the editor to deselect the actual selected element. There won't be any kind of response (from the api iframe) to this message.\r\nThe message you need to send: __loseSelected__\r\n\r\n###Set code element content\r\nThe response for the incoming messages from [code elements](#code-elements). You need to post a stringified json as the message string. It should have two properties:\r\n  - action {String} The name of the action: __SetCodeElementContent__\r\n  - content {String} The content (query string) you want to set to the element   \r\n\r\nThe message you need to send: __{\"action\": \"SetCodeElementContent\", \"content\": \"your content goes here\"}__\r\n\r\n###Insert to cursor in wysiwyg editor\r\nThe response for the incoming messages from [texteditor buttons](#wysiwyg-texteditor-button). You need to post a stringified json as the message string. It should have two properties:\r\n  - action {String} The name of the action: __InsertToCursor__\r\n  - content {String} The content (placeholders) the user wants to insert to the cursor \r\n\r\nThe message you need to send: __{\"action\": \"InsertToCursor\", \"content\": \"your content goes here\"}__\r\n\r\n###Set header button content\r\nThe response for the incoming message from [header button](#header-button). You need to post a stringified json as the message string. It should have two properties:\r\n  - action {String} The name of the action: __SetHeaderButtonContent__\r\n  - content {String} The content (query string) the user wants to insert to the head part of the template \r\n\r\nThe message you need to send: __{\"action\": \"SetHeaderButtonContent\", \"content\": \"your content goes here\"}__\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n###Possible response messages\r\nList of the events the iframe can send to your application (as a message).\r\n\r\n###Save result\r\nIt is the answer for the [save project](#save project) request. It can have to different statuses:  \r\nIn case of success the answer message will be the following: __Save result: success__  \r\nIn case of failure the answer message will be the following: __Save result: failed__  \r\n\r\n###Project Loading Started\r\nThe iframe will send you a message at the begining of the project loading.\r\nThe message will be the following: __ProjectLoadingStarted__\r\n\r\n###Project Loading Finished\r\nThe iframe will send you a message when the project loading is done. It can have different statuses:\r\nIn case the project loading was succesful, the message will be the following: __ProjectLoadingSuccess__\r\nIn case the project loading failed, the message will be the following: __ProjectLoadingFailed__\r\n\r\nAvailable Languages\r\n-------------------\r\nYou can set the localization which the api will use.
