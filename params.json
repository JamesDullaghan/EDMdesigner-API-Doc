{"name":"EDMdesigner-API","tagline":"Documentation of the EDMdesigner API for integration projects","body":"EDMdesigner-API\r\n===============\r\n\r\n[EDMdesigner](http://www.edmdesigner.com) is a drag and drop tool for creating responsive HTML e-mail templates very quickly and painlessly, radically increasing your click-through rate. This documentation is to give you a detailed description about the EDMdesigner-API with which you can integrate our editor into any web-based system (e.g. a CRM, CMS, WebShop or anything else you can imagine).\r\n\r\nTo start developing with our api, please request an API_KEY (and a corresponding magic word) at info@edmdesigner.com.\r\n\r\nBasically, the only thing you have to do is to implement one side of the handshaking on your server. When the handshaking is done, you can use the sent object, in which you can find the functions that are communicating with our server.\r\n\r\nThe handshaking is built into the initialization process, so if you implemented the handshaking on your side, everything will work automatically.\r\n\r\nWe provide example implementations that include the handshaking as well. You can find the continously broading list at the end of this page at the Example implementations section.\r\n\r\n##### Table of content\r\n\r\n1. __[Initializin](#initializing)__  \r\n2. __[Handshaking](#handshaking)__  \r\n3. __[Api functions](#api-functions)__  \r\n  1.

In the second line you can see a route parameter in the script's src. By that you can tell the script where to look for the handshaking implementation. For example, if you implemented it in your index.php, you have to replace ##handshaking_route## with index.php. The first parameter is a user id from your system. It can be any string. In case you don't want to handle separate user accounts, just pass there your API_KEY. The last parameter is an error callback which will be called in every request if the request fails. This is not required thus you can set an error callback in one of your function calls (see later) and in that case it will be called instead of this one.\r\n\r\nIn the resulting object (edmDesignerApi) you will find some functions through which you can interact with our system.\r\n\r\n### Handshaking\r\nTo implement the handshaking on your server, you need an API_KEY, a magic word (wich is delivered with your API_KEY), your user's IPv4 address and a timestamp. The logic that handles handshaking has to receive the userId too, because it has to be sent to our server as well. Our API implementation automatically sends the userId in a POST HTTP request. You can set this user id by the first parameter of the initEDMdesignerPlugin.\r\n\r\nAfter concatenating the API_KEY, the IPv4 address of your user, the timestamp (as a string) and your magic word, you have to create an md5 hash of the resulting string.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\thash = md5(API_KEY + ipv4 + timestamp + magic)\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this, you have to send the API_KEY, the userId, the IPv4 address, the timestamp and the generated md5 hash to our server at api.edmdesigner.com/api/token through HTTP.\r\n\r\nIf everything goes well, you get back a token, with which your user can be identified.\r\n\r\n# API functions\r\n## User functions\r\n### edmDesignerApi.listProjects(callback, onErrorCB)\r\nLists the projects of the actual user.\r\n#### Parameters:\r\n  * callback {Function} A function to be called if the request succeeds\r\n  * onErrorCB {Function} A function to be called if the request fails\r\n\r\n#### Example:\r\n\t\r\n\t<script>\r\n\t\tinitEDMdesignerPlugin(\"TestUser\", function(edmDesignerApi) {\r\n\t\t\tedmDesignerApi.listProjects(function(result) {\r\n\t\t\t\tconsole.log(result);\r\n\t\t\t});\r\n\t\t}, onErrorCB);\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tfunction onErrorCB(error) {\r\n\t\t\tconsole.log(error);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t</script>\r\n\r\n___\t\r\n\r\n### edmDesignerApi.createProject(data, callback, onErrorCB)\r\nCreates a new project (a new e-mail template).\r\n#### Parameters:\r\n  * data {Object}\r\n    * data.title {String} The title of the new project.\r\n    * data.description {String} The description of the new project.\r\n    * data.document {Object} An object, which represents a template.

This requires you to implement an upload route on your server and [configure](#configure-api-servers-gallery) our server (you have to do the configuration only once). The user can delete the images as well, so there should be an delete route on your server (it should be in the [gallery configuration](#configure-api-servers-gallery)) .\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Upload route\r\nYou should implement a route on your server which we can use for image upload.\r\n\r\nType: POST\r\n\r\nWe will upload the images as the following. There will be a \"userId\" field in the query of the request, it will contain the id of the user (who wants to upload the image). The image will be uplaoded as a file (the field name will be \"file\") and there will be another field \"userId\", it will contain the same data as the query field \"userId\"\r\n\r\nThe response to our post request should be an image object. The object should have the following properties:\r\n  * url {String} /REQUIRED/ The url where the newly uploaded image can be found.\r\n  * secure_url {String} Http secure version og the image url\r\n  * thumb_url {String} An url where the thumbnail version of the image is available (Tha gallery can work a lot faster if you can provide a thumbnail)\r\n  * name {String} The name of the image. If it is not given then we will you the last segment of the url\r\n  * width {Number} The original width of the image (It can save a lot of process if you can provide this information)\r\n  * height {Number} The original height of the image (It can save a lot of process if you can provide this information)\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Delete route\r\nYou should implement a route on your server side which we can use for deleting images.\r\n\r\nType: POST\r\n\r\nWe will post an objact with two parameters:\r\n  * url {String} The url of the deleted image\r\n  * userId {String} The id of the user who deleted the image.\r\n\r\nYour response to our post request should be 200.

A header will appear on the top of their templates and the footer will appear on the bottom.\r\nThe users won’t be able to edit these two elements or remove them.  \r\nIf you upload any header and/or footer, then the affected users have to use one. If you want to have a group of users who don’t have to use any kind of header and/or footer, then do not upload header and/or footer to all of your users ([general upload](#upload-header-2)) or upload the group an empty header and/or footer. This way they can choose the empty one and then there will be no header and/or footer on their templates.  \r\nYou can upload different kind of headers and/or footers. If you do so, then the affected users will be able to choose which header they want to use, but they still have to use one of them.   \r\nThe newly created document will get a header and/or footer if the user (who created the project) has any header and/or footer. A user can have header and/or footer if it was uploaded directly to him or to his group or if there are headers and/or footers which were uploaded to every users. (The header and/or footer priority is the following: user’s personal headers and/or footers <  user’s group’s headers and/or footers < general headers and/or footers)\r\n\r\nThere is three different ways to upload headers. You can upload it:\r\n  - to all your user ([general header upload](#upload-headers-2)) \r\n  - to a specified group ([upload headers to group](#upload-headers)) \r\n  - to specified user or users ([upload headers to user](#upload-headers-1))\r\n\r\nFooters can be uploaded in the same ways:\r\n  - to everyone ([general footer upload](#upload-footers-2))\r\n  - to a specified group ([upload footers to a group](#upload-footers))\r\n  - to specified user or users ([upload footers to users](#upload-footers-1))\r\n\r\n\r\n### Structure\r\nThe representing object fore header or footer should have the following properties:\r\n  - document {Object} /REQUIRED/ it should be a json object (which represent our templates)\r\n    - root /REQUIRED/ There should be the structure of the header or footer\r\n    - generalSettings\r\n  - id {String} /REQUIRED/ this id is what we use for distinguish the headers from each other so __it should be unique!__ Please note that the id you want to use for the users headers should be different from the ids of the general headers or the ids of the user's group's headers. The same is true for the footers.\r\n  - title {Object} it should contains language code - title string pairs. For example: 'en': 'Green-white header'. The title will appear on the dropdown list. If you don't want to use any other localization then please use the 'en' language code, the default will always be the 'en' regardless of the actual language!  \r\n  - placeholders {Object} it is needed when you want to have more than one supported language on your headers or footers. If you want to know how do the placeholders work please read the [localization](#localization) part of the [headers & footers](#headers--footers) chapter.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Localization\r\nIt is possible to use different localization with the same headers and/or footers but __not required__.  \r\nIf you want to support only one language then you should \"hardcode\" the content of the header or footer to the representing json and it should work perfectly. In that case you do not have to use the placeholders object (see [stucture](#structure)).  \r\nIf you want to support more than one language, then you have to use the placeholders object. You should not write the actual content to the json instead you should use a placeholder (for example if you have a title element in your header or footer, then the text of the title should be the placeholder instead of the actual content. We will replace the placeholders in our application). You can give any kind of name to this placeholder, but it should begin and end with two '#' character (for example: ##title##.). After that you have to insert the placeholder to the placeholders object as follows: the key should be the name of the placeholder, and the value should be an object conatining the language code - value pairs of the actual content.  \r\nExample placeholders object: \r\n\r\n\tplaceholders: { '##title##': {\r\n\t\t\t\t'en': 'The header is a good thing',\r\n\t\t\t\t'hu': 'A fejléc egy jó dolog',\r\n\t\t\t\t//...\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t '##example-palceholder##: {\r\n\t \t\t\t'en': 'It is an example',\r\n\t \t\t\t'hu': 'Ez egy példa',\r\n\t \t\t\t//...\r\n\t \t\t\t}\r\n\t }\r\n\t \r\nYou can localize the name (title) of the headers and/or footers too. The title of a header or footer is the text which will appear on the dropdown list, where the user will be able to choose from them.  \r\nIf you want to support more than one language you just have to put the language code - text pair to the title object (see [structure](#structure)).\r\nAn example title object: \r\n\r\n\ttitle: { 'en': 'example title',\r\n\t\t 'hu': 'példa cím'\r\n\t\t /...\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\t\r\nIf you support a language but you do not want to give the header or footer a different title in the other language, you do not have to, but please note that this way the default title will be used on the dropdown list for this header, and the default is always the 'en' (english) version of the title.  \r\n\r\nExample:  \r\n_We support the english and the hungarian languages. We upload two headers with the following two title objects: title: {'en': 'first \theader'} and title: {'en': 'second header', 'hu': 'Második fejléc'}. If someone select the hungarian language, then in his dropdown \t\tlist there will be two selectable header: 'first header' and 'Második fejléc', but if someone choose the english version, then \t\tthe dropdown list will look like the following: 'first header' and 'second header'._  \r\n\r\nIf you do not give an 'en' (english) title to a header, then it will be generated automatically in our application, so it is suggested to always upload an 'en' version of the title too.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Upload Headers \r\nUpload a list of headers which __all of your users__ will be able to use.

This feature is created for make the template editing more fast so more effective.\r\nA complex elem can binded to a user, to a group of users or to all of the users.\r\nWhen a user uses the editor these binding displays all together and can be used all of them.\r\n\r\nThe administrator of the application can upload complex elems to all of the above possibilities.\r\nThe user of the editor can save complex elems only for him/herself, those will be added to the admin defined items.\r\nThe editor users can also delete those complex elems what are binded to him/herself as a user.\r\n\r\nThese are the 3 ways to upload complex elems as an admin:\r\n  - to all your user ([general complexElems upload](#upload-complexElems)) \r\n  - to a specified group ([upload complexElems to group](#upload-complexElems)) \r\n  - to specified user or users ([upload complexElems to user](#upload-complexElems))\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Structure\r\nThe representing object for a Complex elem should have the following properties:\r\n  - doc {Object} /REQUIRED/ it should be a json object (which represent our templates)\r\n    - type /REQUIRED/ It must be \"BOX\" or \"MULTICOLUMN\"\r\n    - generalSettings\r\n  - id {String} /optional/ this id is what will identify the item for you if you would like to manage it via admin\r\n  - title {Object} /optional/ it should contains language code - title string pairs. For example: 'en': 'Green-white complexElem'. If you miss to give it, we it will receive a default name. The title will appear on the list of the complex element. If you don't want to use any other localization then please use the 'en' language code, the default will always be the 'en' regardless of the actual language!  \r\n\r\n### Localization\r\nIt is possible to use different localization with the same complex elem but __not required__.\r\nYou can localize the title of the complex elem. The title of a complex elem will appear on the list, where the user will be able to choose from.  \r\nIf you want to support more than one language you just have to put the language code - text pair to the title object (see [structure](#structure)).\r\nAn example title object: \r\n\r\n\ttitle: { 'en': 'example title',\r\n\t\t 'hu': 'példa cím'\r\n\t\t /...\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n___\r\n\r\n\r\n##User routes\r\n\r\n##Authentication\r\nTo authenticate these routes, userId and a token (generated to the userId) are needed. Those to should be sent on the request's query.(somehow like this: ?user=userID&token=token ). Please note that every route need to be authenticated expect the one which generate the token.
