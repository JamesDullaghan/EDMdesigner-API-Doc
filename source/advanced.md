# Custom Strings

```javascript
//Custom String object example:
var customStringsObject = {
  id: "validId",
  title: {
    en: "EDM beer"
  },
  items: [
    {
       replacer: "##Svijany##",
       label: "good beer 1"      
    },
    {
       replacer: "##Poutn√≠k##",
       label: {
          en: "good beer 2"
       }
    }
  ]
};
```

The custom strings are an option to provide predefined texts to your users what they can insert while editing text contents.
You can add custom strings to 
- all of your users 
- to specified users
- or to users of a specified group.

The custom strings can be added by bunch of custom string items. Each bunch contains a title what will be displayed as the label of the drop-down list in the text editor, and an id, what provides the identification. By this id it will be possible to remove the bunch.
The id can not contain any special characters, the title is a string or a localization object. In case of localization object it what must contain 'en' property.
Within an item the label property has the same rules.

#Feature Switch
You can allow or forbid some features of our application to a group of your users.
The list of the features you can set at the moment:  
  - gallery {Object}: contains the features of the gallery
    - noUpload {Boolean} If you set this parameter true then the users belong to this group cannot use the upload functionality. If you configured the gallery noUploadText (see [gallery config](#configure-api-servers-gallery)) text then it will appear on the upload tab, otherwise a default text will be used.
    - noUrl {Bollean} If you set this parameter true, then the users of this group cannot use any image not hosted by you. The image from url tab of the gallery will disappear if the feature does not allowed.
    - limit {Number} The number of images the user can upload. If you do not want to set any limit then leave this parameter undefined. If a user reach the limit, then he won't be able to upload any more image and if you configured the gallery limitReached (see [gallery config](#configure-api-servers-gallery)) text then it will be displayed otherwise a default text will be used.  Please note that the 0 limit and the noUpload are almost equivalent except a different message will appear on the upload tab if you use one or the other.

This list is constantly expanding with time!






#Feature configuration
This is a new development which will be used everywhere from the next api version. Right now it is only used in a few features [texteditor buttons](#wysiwyg-texteditor-buttons).
It is quite similar to the [feater switch](#feature-switch), but it is a little bit "smarter". Here you can configure the features on four different level. Each level inherits the upper levels configuration but has greater priority.  Basicly the configurationions are merged into each other, but the lower levels always override the inherited configurations, if they have different configuration, but not everything, only the affected settings. The inheritance chain is the following:

apiClient -> apiClientInstance(apiKey) -> group -> user.

For example, we have a configuration named "feature" on apiClient level with value 5. We have to users with different groups, in one of this two groups we override this feature with value 8. So the user who belongs to this group will get a feature configuration with feature 8 (he inherited 5 from the apiClient, but his group overrided it to 8, so in the en he inherited feature 8) while the other user will get feature 5 (he inherited it from the apiClient's feature configuration).

If you want to disable a feature on one of this four levels, you have to give the feature a false value. (it is do not give any value to a feature then that feauter will be inherited from the upper levels, so it is important to give the feature a false value).

For example, we have a configuration named "feature" on apiClient level with value {"number": 5}. We have to users with different groups, in one of this two groups we override this feature with value false. So the user who belongs to this group won't get the feature configuration (he inherited {"number": 5} from the apiClient, but his group overrided it to false, so in the en he does not inherited this feature. this basicly means that this user cannot use the given feature) while the other user will get feature {"number": 5} (he inherited it from the apiClient's feature configuration, so he can use this feature).














# Favorite elements

The complex elem is a possible tool to save a BOX or MULITCOLL element with all of it contents to be able to reuse it. This feature is created for make the template editing more fast so more effective.
A complex elem can binded to a user, to a group of users or to all of the users.
When a user uses the editor these binding displays all together and can be used all of them.

The administrator of the application can upload complex elems to all of the above possibilities.
The user of the editor can save complex elems only for him/herself, those will be added to the admin defined items.
The editor users can also delete those complex elems what are binded to him/herself as a user.

These are the 3 ways to upload complex elems as an admin:
  - to all your user ([general complexElems upload](#upload-complex-elems-to-all-users)) 
  - to a specified group ([upload complexElems to group](#upload-complex-elems)) 
  - to specified user or users ([upload complexElems to user](#upload-complex-elems-to-specified-users))



### Structure
The representing object for a Complex elem should have the following properties:  
  - doc {Object} /REQUIRED/ it should be a json object (which represent our templates)
    - type /REQUIRED/ It must be ["BOX"](#box), ["MULTICOLUMN"](#multicolumn) or ["FULLWIDTH_CONTAINER"](#full-width-container)
    - generalSettings
  - id {String} /optional/ this id is what will identify the item for you if you would like to manage it via admin
  - title {Object} /optional/ it should contains language code - title string pairs. For example: 'en': 'Green-white complexElem'. If you miss to give it, we it will receive a default name. The title will appear on the list of the complex element. If you don't want to use any other localization then please use the 'en' language code, the default will always be the 'en' regardless of the actual language!  


### Localization
It is possible to use different localization with the same complex elem but __not required__.
You can localize the title of the complex elem. The title of a complex elem will appear on the list, where the user will be able to choose from.  
If you want to support more than one language you just have to put the language code - text pair to the title object (see [structure](#structure)).
An example title object: 

  title: { 'en': 'example title',
     'hu': 'p√©lda c√≠m'
     /...
    }
