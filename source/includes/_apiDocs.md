## Docs

Document | Description
---|---

[postMessage API](./postMessageApi.html) | By reading this documentation you can learn about how to manipulate the editor itself from the client side. Basically this client side API is based on the [postMessage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) function with which you can send messages between frames from different domains. <ul><li>Basic messages and responses (eg. manual save)</li><li>Hooking on editor events (eg. using your own gallery instead of the built-in one)</li><li>Dynamic data</li><li>Setting elements' properties</li></ul>
[Element descriptors](./documentDescriptors.html) | A detailed description of our element types used in projects and favorite elements. We generate all of our outputs based on these JSON descriptors.
